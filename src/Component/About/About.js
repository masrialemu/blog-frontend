      <p>Most of the indigenous communities are engaged in producing honey from the forest. <br />
      {/* the regional administration gave proper attention and addressed some of the infrastructure problems, the zone with its 47 percent forest coverage has a huge potential for ecotourism. At the moment one has to walk for a 
      few hours from the capital of the zone, Masha town, which do not have asphalt road or 24 hours electricity supply, in order to meet the nearest farmer from Menja community.
      <br />
      The administration can attract more tourists both from local and abroad by only providing houses to tourists who come to visit the natural attraction sites of the zone,” says Woudneh Zenebe, Journalist for The Ethiopian Reporter newspaper, who also traveled on foot for couple of hours to see the amazing Sheksheko Cave and Fountain.

He suggests that such alternative income generating activities along with forest honey and traditional medicine production linked with research firms can protect the forest from being cleared for non-eco-friendly agricultural investments.
<br />
Furthermore, countries can also get money by preserving forests from the global carbon financing scheme even though the process is often tiresome. The idea of Reduced Emission from Deforestation and forest Degradation indigenous people and benefit sharing (REDD++) is to reduce global carbon emission caused by deforestation which is estimated to contribute about 11 percent to the total emission.

In addition, forests also absorb some 20 percent of green house gas emission coming from industries and regulate global temperature, which is contributing climate change.
<br />
Meanwhile, previous carbon financing experiences show that registering forest and getting money of carbon financing is too complex. Preparing documents by employing high profile researchers takes years and unaffordable as it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Latest data shows that out of the total 3,183 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) approved projects, which received carbon financing, Africa’s share stands at 66 of which Ethiopia gets only one.
<br />
For instance, registering the 2,728 hectares of Humbo/Sodo forest took Ethiopia several years and it wouldn’t have been possible without World Vision’s, an international nongovernmental organization, support and 200 million US dollars financing from the World Bank. For a period of 30 years Humbo forest will generate a total of 1.5 million US dollars through carbon credit by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

“We have written Letter of no Objection to over 40 such projects, but none of them are able benefit from the global carbon financing except the Humbo forest because of the complexity and costly process of CDM,” says Selam Kidane, legal officer at the Environment Protection Authority of Ethiopia.
<br />
“Even after registering a forest and obtaining the carbon financing money, we don’t have a clear mechanism in place on how the money will go to the community who preserved the forest,” says Kirubel Teshome, advocacy and information program coordinator at MELCA- Ethiopia.

He argues that unless the community at the grassroots level who preserved the forest gets some kind of benefit, there is no reason for them to start cutting the trees and make money out of it. */}
